I am going to try to make these instructions as simple as posible but its 5am so hopfully you can interpret what I'm trying to say.

prequisites: 
Arch linux: sudo pacman -S xmonad xmonad-contrib kitty rofi picom 
Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install xmonad libghc6-xmonad-contrib-dev kitty rofi compton
Step one: git clone https://github.com/FloralnFading/zerotasteguy/
Step two: move the folders from ".config" to your .config folder. If you dont see it make sure you have "Show hidden files: on"
Step three: move the .xmonad folder into your /home/user/ directory
Step four: logout and then log in to xmonad
Step five: dm me with all your questions when I'm awake
